	Reference for variable naming scheme:
  Variables are attempted to be named so that the broadest category they fit into comes first.
	len: (length) prefix to all lengths and dimensionalities of arrays.
	beg: (beginning) prefix to all starting indexes of layers in the two vals arrays. (also comes in temp form for multiple threads)
	end: (ending) prefix to the final indexes +1 of layers in the two vals arrays. (also comes in temp form for multiple threads)
	jump: (jump) prefix for any variable that precalculates a jump between locations that is not a standard length in any array.
	stop: (stop) prefix for any variable that precalculates a stop index but not the  
	vals: (values) title for anything to do with either the achieved or error values arrays.
	ach: (achieved) title for anything to do with achieved values array.
	err: (error) title for anything to do with error values array.
	vis: (visible) title for anything to do with the visible layer, the one that the current layer looks at.
	temp: (temporary) suffix for a variable that does the job of another, or holds a precaculated value for only the methods run time.
	pos: (position) suffix for a variable that indexs where an algorithm is in an array.
	num: (number) suffix used to denote the position in an array a layer or thread may hold.
