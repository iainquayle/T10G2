CalcNet
TextNet for the purpose of training a net to convert img to text. TextNet is starting single threaded, but will hopefully be multi to help facilitate better training.
CalcNet will be the merger of TextNet and a Calculator 

Text TODO:
 (Training data input (data should be in the form of 1d float arrays))
 (Dense/Conv2D - save and init)
 (Conv2D - eval and train)
 (Net Architecture) 
 (Multi thread - MAYBE)
Calc TODO:
 (takes in string representing equation)
 (start with dealing with equations with no unknown variables)
