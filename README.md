CalcNet
Currently CalcNet is composed of TextNet and CalculatorGUI which are going to be connected to each other and the soon to be implemented image processing.

The following are insturctions on how to run the calculator and how train the neural network:


How to run the calculator using an IDE:
1- Create a new folder in "CalculatorGUI" named "engine" and place everything that's inside "CalculatorGUI" into "engine"
1- Open CalculatorGUI.java in your preferred IDE (Example: Eclipse)
2- Compile and run the code on your preferred IDE*
3- Follow on-screen instructions

*If you're not sure how to run code on your IDE you can use the following google search "How to run and compile java code using PreferredIDE" replace PreferredIDE with the name of your IDE.

How to run the calculator using the command line:
1- Create a new folder in "CalculatorGUI" named "engine" and place everything that's inside "CalculatorGUI" into "engine"
2- Open your command line
3- Use the command "cd location of CalculatorGUI/engine"* to move to the directory CalculatorGUI/engine
4- Compile the code using the command "javac *.java"
5- Run the code by using the command "java CalculatorGUI"
6- Follow on-screen instructions

*Do not simply write "location of CalculatorGUI", write the directory of your Calculator.java file.


How to train the Neural Netwrok using an IDE*:
1- Save the training data file and the split training data file inside the folder "TextNet" (training data can't be uploaded to github due to file size)

2- Move the folder NetArch2* to inside the folder TextNet
3- Create a new folder in "TextNet" named "engine" and place everything that's inside "TextNet" into "engine"
3- Open TextNet.Java in your preferred IDE
4- Follow on screen instructions

*If you're not sure how to run code on your IDE you can use the following google search "How to run and compile java code using PreferredIDE" replace PreferredIDE with the name of your IDE.

*NetArch2 contains the config files neccessary to run the neural network architecture


How to train the Neural Netwrok using the command line:
1- Save the training data file and the split training data file inside the folder TextNet (training data can't be uploaded to github due to file size)

2- Move the folder NetArch2* to inside the folder TextNet
3- Create a new folder in "TextNet" named "engine" and place everything that's inside "TextNet" into "engine"
4- Open the command line
5- Use the command "cd location of TextNet/engine"* to move to the directory TextNet
6- Compile the code using the command "javac *.java".

7- Run the code using "java TextNet"

*Do not simply write location, write the directory that will put you inside the folder TextNet
